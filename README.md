# fee_waiver
Creates a Fee Waiver Motion from Form Inputs

Simple script to find-and-replace text on a commonly filed motion.  Saves the new motion with client's first and last name.

Sample motion included.

Uses an input box instead of command line arguments to be "user-friendly."  Have included .bat script for the same reason.
