# fee_waiver
Creates a batterer's treatment program fee waiver motion (Cal. Pen. Code 1203.097) from form inputs.

Simple script to find-and-replace text on a commonly filed motion.  Saves the new motion with client's first and last name.

Sample motion included.

Uses an input box instead of command line arguments to be "user-friendly."  Have included .bat script for the same reason.
